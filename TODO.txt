Meet with Nikos to clean up repository. Do we want to include dependencies for Fortran, hbplus, pdbset, etc.?
How to make repository publicly accessible. Can we change the name of it? Can we add David Boyer as an owner?
Once respository is finalized, make sure to include the link to it in the manuscript.
